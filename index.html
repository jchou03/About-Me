			I started my high school expierence in San Mateo High, but I managed to get accepted to Design Tech High School about two weeks into the 
			school year, but because of certain scheduling quirks, Design Tech actually didn't start until the next Tuesday, so I wouldn't miss any 
			school at all. I was struggling with many different issues at the time, and it was actually a hard decision for me. I started my second
			first day of high school and was understandably nervious, but I made quite a few friends since then, one of which actually got transfered
			last minute like me and didn't have assigned classes, so we got to ackwardly sit together on the side in some classes. I had one of the
			more interesting advisors out of the staff members, Freedom! He was a great person but ended up leaving at the end of my freshman year.
			I got closer to a lot of my peers during the 9th grade camping trip, and played a ton of card games. :D I got to experience some of the 
			Oracle classes and got to meet many good friends in those classes, some of which have websites that I have linked!
